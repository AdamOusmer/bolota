/**
 * The bot's resting expression.
 *
 * The face is only two capsules, so everything rides on four levers: head
 * orientation, eye separation, their proportions, and each eye's own tilt.
 * It's this last one that makes anger and sadness possible: they need
 * MIRRORED tilts (the tops converging or diverging), which is impossible
 * with head roll alone, since that tilts both eyes the same way.
 *
 * Only the resting state carries this expression. The video's expressive
 * states (wink, wide eyes, notification) keep their own: that's the one
 * we came to reproduce.
 *
 * The amplitudes lean on bible-strong-avatar-lab, which exposes the same
 * model (head X/Y/Z, width and height per eye, separation, angle per eye):
 * there, width ranges 0.8 to 2.7 times neutral, height 0.3 to 1.5, and
 * angles up to ±80°. This stays within that envelope.
